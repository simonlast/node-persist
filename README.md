# node-persist
## (localStorage on the server)

### Super-easy asynchronous persistent data structures in Node.js, modeled after HTML5 localStorage
Node-persist doesn't use a database. Instead, JSON documents are stored in the file system for persistence. Because there is no network overhead, node-persist is just about as fast as a database can get. Node-persist uses the HTML5 localStorage API, so it's easy to learn.

This is still a work in progress. Send pull requests please.
## Note
If you're looking for the version that supports both `synchronous` and `asynchronous` use `node-persist@2.1.0`

## Install

```sh
$ npm install node-persist
```

## Basic Example

```js
const storage = require('node-persist');

//you must first call storage.init
await storage.init( /* options ... */ );
await storage.setItem('name','yourname')
console.log(await storage.getItem('name')); // yourname
```

## Run the counter example:

```sh
$ cd examples/counter
$ node counter.js
$ open up localhost:8080
```

## 3.0.0 change logs

Non-backward changes

* All the `*Sync` functions were removed, __every__ operation is now __asynchronous__
* All the `persist*` functions were removed
* __Nothing__ is held up in __RAM__. Use your own memory caching module, i.e. [nano-cache](https://github.com/akhoury/nano-cache)
* [Node 7.6+](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41757243/493756) is required now, we're using `async/await`
* `continuous` and `interval` options were removed, since we immediately persist to disk now, __asynchronously__
* `forEach` callback now accepts an object `callback({key, value})` instead of 2 arguments `callback(key, value)`

## 2.0.0 change logs

Non-backward changes

* filenames on the file system are now md5 hashed now and the structure of the saved data has changed to include the ttl in them.
* no longer need/support a `options.ttlDir`, since the `ttls` are now stored in the same file as each value
* added `expiredInterval` option
* added `forgiveParseErrors` option

## 1.0.0 change logs

Mostly non-backward changes

* `storage.getItem()` now returns a promise
* `storage.valuesWithKeyMatch()` no longer accepts a callback
* `storage.values()` no longer accepts a callback
* `storage.key()` is gone
* The default `dir` is now `process.cwd() + (dir || '.node-persist/storage')`, unless you use an absolute path
* added `storage.get()`, alias to `getItem()`
* added `storage.set()`, alias to `setItem()`
* added `storage.del()`, `storage.rm()`, as aliases to `removeItem()`
* Keys, on the file system are base64 encoded with the replacement of the `/`

## API Documentation

#### `async init(options, [callback])`
if the storage dir is new, it will create it
##### Options
You can pass `init()` an options object to customize the behavior of node-persist

These are the defaults
```js
await storage.init({
	dir: 'relative/path/to/persist',

	stringify: JSON.stringify,

	parse: JSON.parse,

	encoding: 'utf8',

	logging: false,  // can also be custom logging function

	ttl: false, // ttl* [NEW], can be true for 24h default or a number in MILLISECONDS or a valid Javascript Date object

	expiredInterval: 2 * 60 * 1000, // every 2 minutes the process will clean-up the expired cache

    // in some cases, you (or some other service) might add non-valid storage files to your
    // storage dir, i.e. Google Drive, make this true if you'd like to ignore these files and not throw an error
    forgiveParseErrors: false

});

```
#### `async getItem(key)`
This function will get the value for that key stored on disk

```js
let value = await storage.getItem('obj');
```

#### `async setItem(key, value, [options])`
This function sets 'key' in your database to 'value'

```js
await storage.setItem('fibonacci',[0,1,1,2,3,5,8]);
await storage.setItem(42,'the answer to life, the universe, and everything.');
await storage.setItem(42,'the answer to life, the universe, and everything.', {ttl: 1000*60 /* 1 min */ });
```
\* The only option available when calling `setItem(key, value, option)` is `{ttl: Number|Date}`

#### `async updateItem(key, value, [options])`
This function updates a 'key' in your database with a new 'value' without touching the `ttl`, however, if the `key` was not found of it was `expired` a new item will get set

```js
await storage.updateItem(42,'the answer to life, the universe, and everything.', {ttl: 1000*60*10 /* 10 minutes */ });
await storage.updateItem(42,'means nothing, do not trust wikipedia'); // ttl is still the same, will expired in 10 minutes since it was first set
```
\* The only option available when calling `setItem(key, value, option)` is `{ttl: Number|Date}`

#### `async removeItem(key)`
This function immediately deletes it from the file system asynchronously

```js
await storage.removeItem('me');
```

#### `async clear()`
This function immediately deletes all files from the file system asynchronously.

```js
await storage.clear();
```

#### `async values()`
This function returns all of the values

```js
await storage.setItem("batman", {name: "Bruce Wayne"});
await storage.setItem("superman", {name: "Clark Kent"});
console.log(await storage.values()); //output: [{name: "Bruce Wayne"},{name: "Clark Kent"}]
```
#### `async valuesWithKeyMatch(match)`
This function returns all of the values matching a string or RegExp
```js
await storage.setItem("batman", {name: "Bruce Wayne"});
await storage.setItem("superman", {name: "Clark Kent"});
await storage.setItem("hulk", {name: "Bruce Banner"});
console.log(await storage.valuesWithKeyMatch('man')); //output: [{name: "Bruce Wayne"},{name: "Clark Kent"}]
// also accepts a Regular Expression
console.log(await storage.valuesWithKeyMatch(/man/)); //output: [{name: "Bruce Wayne"},{name: "Clark Kent"}]
```
#### `async keys()`
this function returns an array of all the keys in the database.
```js
console.log(await storage.keys()); // ['batman', 'superman']
```
#### `async length()`
This function returns the number of keys stored in the database.
```js
console.log(await storage.length()); // 2
```
#### `async forEach(callback)`
This function iterates over each key/value pair and executes an asynchronous callback as well

```javascript
storage.forEach(async function(datum) {
	// use datum.key and datum.value
});
```
### Factory method

#### `create(options)` - synchronous, static method

If you choose to create multiple instances of storage, you can. Just avoid using the same `dir` for the storage location.
__You still have to call `init` after `create`__ - you can pass your configs to either `create` or `init`

```javascript
const storage = require('node-persist');
const myStorage = storage.create({dir: 'myDir', ttl: 3000});
await myStorage.init();
```

#### Tests

```
npm install
npm test
```
